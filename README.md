# Chloric

A watcher/compiler for Clojure/[Chlorine](https://github.com/chlorinejs/chlorine)

## Get Chloric

You can build chloric with:
```
lein uberjar
```
or [download](https://github.com/chlorinejs/chloric/downloads) the jar file.

## Usage

```
java -jar chloric-0.1.5-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar -r 2000 some-dirs-or-files
```
...or you may prefer [`drip`](https://github.com/flatland/drip/) to `java` command.
A watcher will start and check for changes every 2 seconds.

A bash script named `chloric` should be even more convenient:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
drip -jar {PATH_TO}/chloric-{VERSION}-standalone.jar "$@"
```
